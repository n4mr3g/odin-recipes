		<h1>Creamy Pumpkin Pasta Bake</h1>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound rotini pasta</li>
			<li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
			<li>1 cup diced onion</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
			<li>2 Â½ cups chicken broth</li>
			<li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons crumbled cooked bacon</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
			<li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<h4>Step 1</h4>
		<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>

		<h4>Step 2</h4>
		<p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</p>

		<h4>Step 3</h4>
		<p>Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain sausage on paper towels and reserve 2 tablespoons grease in the skillet. Add oil to grease in the skillet; cook and stir onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot oil-grease until onion is soft, about 3 minutes.</p>

		<h4>Step 4</h4>
		<p>Stir chicken broth, pumpkin, bacon, Italian seasoning, and salt into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir cream and sausage into broth mixture and simmer until creamy and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add rotini and gently toss. Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with Parmesan cheese.</p>

		<h4>Step 5</h4>
		<p>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown, about 35 minutes.</p>
